# Genetic Algorithm: Task_Problem
In a task assignment problem, each task must be performed by one person. We have t tasks as columns of the matrix and p persons. The input to the problem is a table, a matrix which is found in the Matrix.txt file. The martix is a representation of how well each person(A to M) perfomes each task represented by numbers from(1 to 10). The higher the number, the better the person performs the task. The solution to the problem is the assignment of persons to tasks (one task per person) that produces the best overall score.
