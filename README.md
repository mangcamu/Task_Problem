# Genetic Algorithm: Task_Problem
In a task assignment problem, each task must be performed by one person. We have t tasks and p persons. The input to the problem is a table, an example of which is shown below in Table 1. The table shows how well each person. (A to M) performs each task (1 to 10). The higher the number, the better the person performs the task. The solution to the problem is the assignment of persons to tasks (one task per person) that produces the best overall score
